# Hi, this is a Script that I've been using to create a Linux Gateway for small networks
# Its almost entirely based on a Script I found on the internet 2 years ago
#
# I put it here only to be able to work on it and hopefully improve it
#
# The eth's order is,
#
# eth0 and eth1 are for LAN use (I can't remember the reason why I use 2 eth's for lan)
#
# have fun
