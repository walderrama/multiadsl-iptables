Hi, this is a Script that I've been using to create a Linux Gateway for small networks
It's almost entirely based on a Script I found 2 years ago

all kudos are for Luciano Ruetes
I put it here only to be able to work on it and hopefully improve it

 The eth interface order is,

eth0 and eth1 are for LAN use ; eth2 and eth3 are the adsl WAN connections

 have fun
