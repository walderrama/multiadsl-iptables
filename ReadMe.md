Hi, this is a Script that I've been using to create a Linux Gateway for small networks
It's almost entirely based on a Script I found 2 years ago

all kudos are for Luciano Ruetes
I put it here only to be able to work on it and hopefully improve it

 The eth interface order is,

eth0 is for LAN use 
eth1 and eth2 are the adsl WAN connections

 have fun
