 Hi, this is a Script that I've been using to create a Linux Gateway for small networks
 Its almost entirely based on a Script I found on the internet 2 years ago

 all kudos are for Luciano Ruetes
 I put it here only to be able to work on it and hopefully improve it

 The eth's order is,

 eth0 and eth1 are for LAN use (I can't remember the reason why I use 2 eth's for lan)

 have fun
